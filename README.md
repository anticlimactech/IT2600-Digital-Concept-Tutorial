# Internet Security
IT2600 Final - Digital Concept Tutorial 

[Security breaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach), where a malicious party gains access to sensitive data from a website or program, are becoming more and more common as computers get faster and the Internet becomes an ever-growing part of our daily lives.

[Here is a list of security breaches that have occured in 2018.](https://www.identityforce.com/blog/2018-data-breaches) 

[Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com/) allows you to search with your email address to see if any sites you use have been part of a data breach.

It is impossible to protect yourself and your data from every possible security risk, but there are some good ways to improve your security throughout your daily life: 

Only visit trusted websites when surfing the web, and avoid clicking on suspicous links and ads. Be careful when opening emails and their attachments, and keep an eye out for emails that "require immediate attention", or seem too good to be true. Rather than following links in emails, navigate to the site directly instead. 

The University of Missouri's IT Department offers some suggestions to help you [avoid phishing scams here.](https://www.umsystem.edu/makeitsafe/phishing)

One simple habit to adopt is [locking your computer or other devices](http://www.netstandard.com/always-lock-computer/) whenever you are not using them, even if you just leave for a second. 

Another simple change is not writing passwords down and posting them for others to [inadvertently see](https://hotforsecurity.bitdefender.com/blog/hawaiis-missile-alert-agency-keeps-its-password-on-a-post-it-note-19461.html).

One of the most important things you can do, is to use strong passwords that are different for every site. Many times, if a malicious party is able to obtain login and password information for one website, they will try those same credentials on several other sites, because many people use the same password over and over again.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U-RbOKanYs) shows just how easy passwords can be to crack, once an attacker has password hashes from a breached website.

[How to choose a password](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NjQ9b3pgIg), [Diceware & Passwords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe_3cFuSw1E), and [Diceware](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) provide some tips to help you create stronger passwords. The University of Missouri's IT Department also offers some good [suggestions to help make your passwords stronger.](https://umsystem.edu/makeitsafe/passwords)

It's also a good idea to consider adding [2 Factor Authentication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXFYT-BG2So), especially to some of your more sensitive logins. 2FA combines something you know, like your password, with something you have, like a code generated by an [authenticator app](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/) on your phone. This can help make it even harder for a malicious party to compromise your login credentials.

[Hashing Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4b8ktEV4Bg), [SHA: Secure Hashing Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY), and [How NOT to store passwords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtInClXe1Q) are also good videos to help explain how hashing works, and touch on how user authentication should be handled in a web development environment.

If this is all starting to sound a little complicated, you're not alone! A good [password manager](https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475964,00.asp) can take care of generating and storing complex passwords for you, and now all you have to remember is one good, complex password for the Master Password of your manager. There are several free options, and options with purchaseable premium features. I personally use [SafeInCloud](https://safe-in-cloud.com/en/) due to its one time fee and its ability to store your password database on your own cloud service, such as GoogleDrive or OneDrive.
