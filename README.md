IT2600 Final - An Internet Security Digital Concept Tutorial 

[Security breeches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach), where a malicious party gains access to sensitive data from a website or program, are becoming more and more common as the Internet becomes an ever-growing part of our daily lives.

[Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com/) allows you to search with your email address to see if any sites you use have been part of a data breech.

It is impossible to protect yourself and your data from every possible security risk, but there are some good ways to improve your security throughout your daily life.

One simple habit to adopt is locking your computer or other devices whenever you are not using them, even if you just leave for a second. 

One of the most important things you can do, is to use strong passwords that are different for every site. Many times, if a malicious party is able to obtain login and password information for one website, they will try those same credentials on several
other sites, because many people use the same password over and over again.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U-RbOKanYs) shows just how easy passwords can be to crack, once an attacker has password hashes from a breeched website.
